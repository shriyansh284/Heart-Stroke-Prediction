# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
Developed a machine learning solution using K-Nearest Neighbors to predict heart disease risk from clinical data. Integrated with a Streamlit web app, allowing users to input medical parameters and receive real-time predictions. Implemented a preprocessing pipeline with scaling, encoding, and feature alignment for model reliability.
