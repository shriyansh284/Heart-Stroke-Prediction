# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
Developed a machine learning solution using K-Nearest Neighbors to predict heart disease risk from clinical data. Integrated with a Streamlit web app, allowing users to input medical parameters and receive real-time predictions. Implemented a preprocessing pipeline with scaling, encoding, and feature alignment for model reliability.

# 🚀 Features:
🧠 Machine Learning Model (KNN): Predicts heart disease risk based on patient parameters.
⚡ Real-time Predictions: Users can input age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG, and more.
🔄 Preprocessing Pipeline: Scaling, encoding, and feature alignment ensure reliable outputs.
🌐 Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for a simple and user-friendly interface.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Joblib
Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

# 📊 Workflow:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and scaled clinical data.
Model Training: Built and evaluated KNN classifier.
Deployment: Integrated with Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
